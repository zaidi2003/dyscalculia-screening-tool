# Dyscalculia Screening Tool
Dyscalculia Screening Tool is an accessible application developed as part of my senior project (SProj), aimed at helping educators and parents identify early signs of dyscalculia in students. The tool presents age-appropriate questions related to numbers, counting, and basic time and quantity understanding, offering a simple way to observe potential learning difficulties. Although it is not a formal diagnostic instrument, it serves as an important first step in recognizing students who may need further evaluation or support.
